// The app should display standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). 
// Additionally, each hour should be color coded to reflect whether the time slot is in the past, the present,
//  or the future. This will change depending on the time of day.

// Each time slot should represent one hour and contain the following:
    // The time
    // A field to hold user input
    // A save button

// Clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in localStorage.

// Near the top of the calendar, the application should display the current day. 


// You'll need to use the Moment.js library to work with date and time. 
// Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

// Minimum Requirements
